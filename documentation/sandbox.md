- you can assign multiple variables at once, ie x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
- wrapping list in range like list(range(5)) puts output of loop in a list, also range can have 3 arguments, for example:
  range(2, 11, 2) would start values at 2 and jump by intervals of 2 hence the third argument so 2, 4, 6, 8 ,10 is output
- A list comprehension such as squares = [value**2 for value in range(1,11)] combines a list and for loop and automatically
  appends each new item
